# Intro
Supertest provides a high-level API for making HTTP requests and asserting on the responses received, which makes it a popular choice for testing web applications. Jest is a testing framework that can be used to run tests and make assertions, but it does not provide direct support for making HTTP requests or working with web APIs.

While Supertest can be used with other testing frameworks besides Jest, such as Mocha or AVA, it is commonly used with Jest because of the ease of integration and the fact that both tools are part of the larger JavaScript ecosystem.

So to summarize, Supertest is a library for testing HTTP requests and responses, while Jest is a testing framework that can be used to run tests and make assertions. Although Supertest is not dependent on Jest, the two are often used together in testing Node.js applications.
